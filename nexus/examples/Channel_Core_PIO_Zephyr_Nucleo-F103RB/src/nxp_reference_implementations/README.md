# `nxp_*` Reference Implementations

When using the Nexus Library, functions from the `nexus/include` folder
beginning with `nxp_` need to be implemented by the product code.

This folder contains reference implementations that can be used as-is
in the example STM32F103RB Zephyr project, or can be modified for use
in a different project.
