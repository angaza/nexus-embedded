# Release Notes

Version can be found in `include/MODULE_VERSION.h`.

`MODULE_VERSION.h` indicates the version of embedded code, and refers to
changes that do not necessarily impact any functionality outside of the
embedded repository.

`NEXUS_VERSION` is a systemwide version number, which indicates compatibility
with other repositories (primarily with the [`nexus-python`](https://github.com/angaza/nexus-python)
repository, which is the 'server-side' code coordinating with the embedded code
in this repository).

Both version fields are semantic version numbers, e.g.:

<MAJOR>.<MINOR>.<PATCH>

Where any code from the same major version should be backwards-compatible
with other code of the same major version, but is *not* compatible with
different major version codes.

## Embedded Module Version 1.0.0

Compatible with NEXUS_VERSION >= 2.1

* Adds client-side request- and reply- handling interfaces, including support for
query strings and "reply context". This context stores information about the request that
can be used to process the corresponding reply when it is received from the server.

* Add "rtr" (Resource Type Registry) to the resource registration API. The "rtr" value is
required for all Nexus Channel resources as per the specification at the time of this
release. It is intended to be used in resource discovery, to be implemented in a future
release.

* Rename public interfaces in `include/` to avoid using `core` for names of
common/baseline code used by all Nexus implementations. This is done to avoid
confusing these functions and definitions with "Nexus Channel Core", which is unrelated.

* Add support for "Nexus Channel Core" only `Kconfig` compilation option
(More on Nexus Channel Core [here](https://angaza.github.io/nexus-channel-models/))

* Apply code style formatting to all source in the `oc/` folder/subfolders

* Add an embedded sample program using a PlatformIO board running Zephyr OS. The sample
provides an interactive demonstration of client and server behavior with a battery
resource implemented to the specification as of this release.

## Embedded Module Version 0.8.0

Compatible with NEXUS_VERSION >= 2.1

* Add support for keycode 'restricted' flag, which is set by product
code (via interfaces in `nx_keycode`) and is reset via a special keycode
available in both small and full keycode protocols
(see https://github.com/angaza/nexus-python/pull/8 for keycode generation)

* Code is more C++ friendly (header files updated with `extern "C"`),
modifications made to pass stricter C++ compilation checks (no need for
implementing project to use `fpermissive`, tested with G++-10)

* More strict static analysis, use multiple compilers for CI test and analysis
builds (GCC-10 with address sanitization and Clang 10)

* Fixed unit tests that had memory / address sanitizer errors (flagged by
Valgrind and/or GCC address sanitizer tools)
