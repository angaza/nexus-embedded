      description: |-
        This resource indicates the remaining PAYG (pay-as-you-go) credit of
        a specific device. Credit may be time-based or usage-based.

        `supportedModes` and `modes` are implemented similar to the description
        of  `oic.r.mode` (https://www.oneiota.org/revisions/5310).

        Any device may be 'disconnected'.
        Controller-capable devices may be 'leading'
        Accessory-capable devices may be 'following'
        Dual-mode capable devices may also be 'relaying'.
        
        A "Following" device has PAYG credit managed by another device which is
        "Leading".
        
        A "Relaying" device has PAYG credit managed by another device which is
        "Leading", but a third device follows the "Relaying" device ('chaining'
        the same credit from device A to device C through device B, even though
        devices A and C are not directly connected).

        The default interface is 'oic.if.rw'. To retrieve the baseline OCF
        information, it is necessary to query with 'if=oic.if.baseline'.

        Application security constraints -
        When used with Nexus Channel, the device POSTing must be a controller
        with an active Nexus Channel Link to this device.
